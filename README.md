# HappyHamster

During the beginning of the [Covid-19 Pandamic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) in germany we participated in the [#WirVsVirus](https://wirvsvirus.org/) Hackathon.

In the time span of a weekend we created [HappyHamster](https://github.com/Happy-Hamster) - a community driven map, which shows the live occupancy rate of supermarkets.
Later our fellow students joined our efforts and we were able to add more store types in a periode of three months.

We got featured in multiple press articles:
